# Pointer Size Demonstration Exercise

In this exercise, you will work with pointers of different data types (int\*, char\*, float\*, double\*) and use the `sizeof` operator to determine the size of these pointers.

## Instructions

1. Declare and initialize the following variables of different data types:
   - An integer variable (`int`) with an initial value.
   - A character variable (`char`) with an initial value.
   - A floating-point variable (`float`) with an initial value.
   - A double-precision variable (`double`) with an initial value.

2. Declare pointers for each of the above data types. For example, declare an `int*` to store the address of the integer variable, a `char*` for the character variable, and so on.

3. Store the addresses of the corresponding variables in the respective pointers. Use the address-of operator `&` to obtain the address of a variable and assign it to the pointer.

4. Use the `sizeof` operator to determine the size (in bytes) of each of the pointers.

5. Display the size of each pointer using `printf` or a similar method.


Feel free to write a C or C++ program to complete this exercise and observe the differences in pointer sizes.

Have fun exploring the sizes of pointers for different data types!
