# Car Cost Calculator Exercise

## Introduction
This program should help someone calculate the total cost of owning a car over a period of time. The program should use functions to simplify the calculation process.

## Story
Your friend, Alex, is planning to buy a new car. He wants to estimate the total cost of ownership, including the initial purchase price, fuel expenses, and maintenance costs over a certain period.

## Instructions

1. Write a C++ program with the following functions:

   a. `inputPurchasePrice`: This function should prompt the user to input the initial purchase price of the car and return this value.

   b. `inputFuelExpenses`: This function should prompt the user to input monthly fuel expenses for the car and return the total fuel cost over a specified period.

   c. `inputMaintenanceCosts`: This function should prompt the user to input monthly maintenance costs and return the total maintenance cost over the same period.

   d. `calculateTotalCost`: This function should take the purchase price, total fuel cost, and total maintenance cost as parameters and return the total cost of car ownership.

   e. `displayTotalCost`: This function should display the total cost of owning the car.

2. In the `main` function:

   a. Use the `inputPurchasePrice` function to input the initial purchase price of the car.

   b. Use the `inputFuelExpenses` function to input the monthly fuel expenses and calculate the total fuel cost over a specified period.

   c. Use the `inputMaintenanceCosts` function to input the monthly maintenance costs and calculate the total maintenance cost over the same period.

   d. Use the `calculateTotalCost` function to determine the total cost of car ownership.

   e. Use the `displayTotalCost` function to display the total cost to the user.

3. Ensure that the program provides clear instructions and feedback to the user.

4. Test your program with different purchase prices, fuel expenses, and maintenance costs to verify its correctness.

## Example Output
