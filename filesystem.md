# Exercise: File Management Simulation

## Objective

Write a C program that simulates a basic file management system using loops. The program should allow users to perform file-related operations, such as creating, deleting, and listing files. The program should do the following:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the names of files.

2. Display a menu of options to the user:
   - Create a new file
   - Delete a file
   - List all files
   - Exit

3. Use a loop (either `for` or `while`) to repeatedly display the menu and ask the user to choose an option.

4. Depending on the user's choice, use loops and appropriate logic to perform the following actions:
   - For creating a new file, ask the user to input a file name and add it to the list of files.
   - For deleting a file, ask the user to input the name of the file to delete and remove it from the list of files.
   - For listing all files, display a list of all file names in the system.
   - For exiting, terminate the program.

5. Ensure that the program continues to run and allows the user to perform multiple file management operations until they decide to exit.

6. Provide suitable messages and feedback to the user after each operation.

## Instructions

1. Initialize an empty list to store file names.

2. Implement a loop (either `for` or `while`) that repeatedly displays the menu and asks the user to choose an option.

3. Use nested loops within the main loop to perform file management operations based on the user's choice.

4. Include error handling to handle cases where the user tries to delete a non-existing file.

5. After each operation, ask the user if they want to perform another operation or exit.

6. Provide suitable messages to guide the user through the process.
